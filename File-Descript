Main.c FILE ----- The main function is the entry point to the program and is responsible for setting up the environment, reading input from the user, and executing commands. The other functions, such as _putchar() and _puts(), are helper functions that are used by the main function to perform various tasks, such as writing characters and strings to the standard output.




Parse.c FILE ------ function called parse_line() that takes a string as input and returns the number of tokens (i.e. words separated by spaces) in the string. The function uses the strtok() function, which is a standard C function for splitting a string into tokens based on a delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is a space, so the function splits the input string into individual words. It then stores these words in an array of char pointers called tokens and returns the number of tokens that were found.

The parse_line() function also has a helper function called print_string() which is used to print the last token in the tokens array, followed by a newline character. This helper function is a simple implementation of the write() function, which is a standard C function for writing data to a file descriptor.





envbuiltin.c FILE ------ function called envbuiltin() that prints the current environment variables to the standard output. It does this by iterating over an array of strings called environ, which is a global variable defined in the standard C library. This array contains the environment variables that are set for the current process.

The envbuiltin() function has a single parameter, environ, which is a double pointer to the environ array. The function then uses a while loop to iterate over the elements in the array, and for each element it prints the string using the _puts() and _putchar() functions. These functions are custom functions that are defined elsewhere in the code, but they likely have similar functionality to the standard puts() and putchar() functions.

The envbuiltin() function returns void, meaning it does not return a value. Instead, it simply prints the environment variables to the standard output and then exits. This is useful for providing the user with information about the current environment, such as the currentworking directory and the user's home directory.






double_free.c FILE ------ called double_free() that frees the memory allocated for a double pointer array. The function takes a double pointer array as an argument and iterates over each element of the array, freeing the memory associated with each element. This is useful for freeing the memory allocated for an array of strings, such as the array variable used in the main() function of the shell. The function does not return a value.

The double_free() function is implemented as follows:

The function starts by declaring a local variable i and initializing it to 0. This variable will be used as a loop counter to iterate through the elements of the double pointer array.

The function then enters a while loop, which will continue to execute as long as the i-th element of the array is not NULL. Inside the loop, the function calls the free() function to free the memory associated with the i-th element of the array. The i variable is then incremented to move to the next element of the array.

Once the while loop ends, the function exits without returning a value.

Overall, the double_free() function is a simple and efficient way to free the memory allocated for a double pointer array. It is important to free this memory when it is no longer needed, as failing to do so can result in memory leaks and other issues.






builtins.c FILE ------- function called builtfunc() that implements the exit builtin command for a simple shell program. The exit builtin is a command that is built intothe shell and can be used to terminate the shell process. When the exit builtin is used, the shell will clean up any dynamically allocated memory, close any open file streams, and then exit with the specified exit status.

The builtfunc() function is implemented as follows:

The function starts by checking if the first argument (i.e. the command name) is "exit". This is done using the _strcmp() function, which is a custom function thatcompares two strings and returns 0 if they are equal.

If the first argument is "exit", then the function proceeds to free the memory that was allocated for the buf, args, and env variables using the free() function. This is important because dynamically allocated memory must be freed when it is no longer needed, otherwise it can cause memory leaks and other issues.

Next, the function closes any open file streams using the fclose() function. This is important because file streams use system resources that must be released when they are no longer needed.

Finally, the function exits the shell using the exit() function and the specified exit status. The exit status is passed to the function as a pointer, which is dereferenced using the * operator before being passed to the exit() function.

If the first argument is not "exit", then the function does nothing and simply returns void. This allows the calling code to check for other builtin commands and handle them accordingly.






_getenv.c FILE ------ The _getenv() function takes a string containing the name of an environment variable as an argument and searches the environ array for a match. If a match is found, the function duplicates the value of the environment variable using the _strdup() function and returns the result. If no match is found, the function returns NULL. This function is useful for retrieving the value of an environment variable, such as the PATH variable, which is used to find the location of executables.





shell.h header FILE - The BUFFER_SIZE macro, which sets the size of the buffer used to store input from the user.

The environ global array, which holds the environment variables for the current process.

The envbuiltin() function, which is used to print the current environment variables to the standard output.

The _getenv() function, which is used to retrieve the value of an environment variable.

The _strlen(), _strcpy(), _strcat(), and other string-related helper functions, which are used to manipulate strings in the program.

The double_free() function, which is used to free the memory allocated for a double pointer array.

The _putchar() and _puts() functions, which are used to write characters and strings to the standard output.
